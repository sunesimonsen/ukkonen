# Ukkonen - Approximate String Matching

[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/ukkonen.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/ukkonen)
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/sunesimonsen/ukkonen.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/sunesimonsen/ukkonen)

This project implements the [Approximate String Matching algorithm by Esko Ukkonen](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0019995885800462) extended with ideas from [An Extension of Ukkonen's Enhanced Dynamic Programming ASM Algorith by Hal Berghel and David Roach](http://berghel.net/publications/asm/asm.pdf).

Ukkonen's algorithm is very competitive with the [Levenshtein distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance) and for longer strings it is much more performant than Levenshtein distance.

In addition to being a competitive alternative to Levenshtein distance, Ukkonen's algorithm also allows you to provide a threshold for the distance which increases the performance even more for texts that are longer than the threshold.

Above you can see the different of using Levenshtein distance and Ukkonen's algorithm for matching sub-trees when diffing HTML.

## Install

```sh
npm install --save ukkonen
```

## Usage

You can find the distance between the strings `Ukkonen` and `Levenshtein` the following way:

```js
var ukkonen = require("ukkonen");

assert.equal(ukkonen("Ukkonen", "Levenshtein"), 8);
```

If you want to limit the distance by a given threshold:

```js
var ukkonen = require("ukkonen");

assert.equal(ukkonen("Ukkonen", "Levenshtein", 6), 6);
assert.equal(ukkonen("Ukkonen", "Levenshtein", 10), 8);
```

## Platform support

The library is ES6 and will work with any JavaScript bundler in the browser as well as Node versions with ES6 support.

## Benchmark

I have benchmarked the library against [the fastest Levenshtein distance implementation on NPM](https://github.com/sindresorhus/leven).

I stole a lot of ideas from [Sindre Sorhus](https://github.com/sindresorhus)'s [leven](https://github.com/sindresorhus/leven) library and I also used it to test my implementation against.
